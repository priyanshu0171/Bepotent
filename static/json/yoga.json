So, according to yoga experts, kapalbhati is something that ensures a 'shining forehead', a symbol of a bright and healthy mind.The known benefits of Kapal Bhati is that it detoxes the lungs, clears the nasal track, increases lung capacity and regulates/ smoothens the breath. It energizes the nervous system, rejuvenates the brain cells and stimulates abdominal organs. These are great benefits, isn’t it? The remaining could be supplementary but don’t focus on that. Kindly refrain from practicing numerous rounds with a hope of losing belly fat. Like everything else in life, Kapal Bhati is best when in moderation.",
